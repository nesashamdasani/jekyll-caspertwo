We all know that the future is here but, that's not all we have in store. This gereation is yes,more gluded to their electronics
but, the results that come out of it is fantastic. Our world has massivly changed throughout the years. 
That's all thanks to technology.

Here is an intresting question, Is technology good or bad? Yes, it helps us, but it also may be damaging our eyesight from
staring at that scren for so long. Technology is such a great thing for this generation, I mean look at what we have achived with it.
New cars,faster networks, newer computers, high-tech phones, satilites, and washing machines too. Yet, is this all to much? 
Everyday our ecomy gets bigger and bigger, so we have to keep up with it and continue with that steady flow. 

I go to a religous school every Satuday, every year they give out calenders which have all thye different functions happening. But, 
this year, kepping up with teachnbology, they have moves the calender to their website. This is just one example of how we move with \
technology. This is it's true power. 

So, lets go back to our question, is technology good or bad? Well, for me it depends in what way you are using technology. 
If you are doing something constructive, say making a website like this one, or coding the next best thing. Then we can't say no.
I mean you helping to build a better future for the next generation to work even harder than us. 

But, like everything it has it's cons. 
You may be changelling others to work hard or you may be doing everything so the next generation can become lazy. 
People have already created self driving cars, and light that turn off with a press of a bottom. We have the whole
world at our figer tips with our computers. What more is there actually left for us to do? Well, we may have eveything 
covered for the next generation to sit back and relax. 

What more to we need? Well, it's only 2017, there are so many other possiblities yet to come.
That's a wrap and thank you for cheaking out one of my 1st posts! Stay tuned every Saturday for more like this
